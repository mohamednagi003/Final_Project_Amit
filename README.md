# Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning
A deep learning-based project that detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not wearing a mask from images.
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images and can be adapted for real-time detection using a webcam or surveillance system.

## Features
Detects mask vs no mask from images.

Trained using the Face Mask Dataset from Kaggle.

Can work in real-time with a webcam.

High accuracy with minimal computational resources.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle:
Face Mask Dataset

The dataset contains:

with_mask — Images of people wearing masks.

without_mask — Images of people without masks.

## Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

OpenCV (for real-time detection)
